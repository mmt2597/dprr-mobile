    "Category": "Calamities",
    "description": "A Tsunami , also known as a seismic sea wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Unlike normal ocean waves which are generated by wind, or tides which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water.<br \/>",
    "Calamity_Tips": "<b>Before a Tsunami<\/b><br \/><br \/>The following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property from the effects of a tsunami:<br \/><br \/>-To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.<br \/><br \/>-Talk to everyone in your household about what to do if a tsunami occurs. Create and practice an evacuation plan for your family. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at night and during inclement weather. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking during an actual emergency.<br \/><br \/>-If the school evacuation plan requires you to pick your children up from school or from another location. Be aware telephone lines during a tsunami alert may be overloaded and routes to and from schools may be jammed.<br \/><br \/>-Knowing your community's warning systems and disaster plans, including evacuation routes.<br \/><br \/>-If you are a tourist, familiarize yourself with local tsunami evacuation protocols. If you are concerned that you will not be able to reach a safe place in time, ask your local emergency management office about vertical evacuation. Some strong (e.g., reinforced concrete) and tall buildings may be able to provide protection if no other options are available.<br \/><br \/>-If an earthquake occurs and you are in a coastal area, turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning.<br \/><br \/><b>Tsunami Warning<\/b><br \/>-A tsunami warning is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate widespread inundation is imminent or expected. Warnings alert the public that dangerous coastal flooding accompanied by powerful cur\u00c2\u00adrents is possible and may continue for several hours after initial arrival. Warnings alert emergency management officials to take action for the entire tsunami hazard zone. Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include the evacuation of low-lying coastal areas, and the repositioning of ships to deep waters when there is time to safely do so. Warnings may be updated, adjusted geographically, downgraded, or canceled. <br \/>To provide the earliest possible alert, initial warnings are normally based only on seismic information.<br \/><br \/><b>Tsunami Advisory<\/b><br \/>-A tsunami advisory is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is imminent or expected. The threat may continue for sev\u00c2\u00aderal hours after initial arrival, but significant inundation is not expected for areas under an advisory. Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include closing beaches, evacuating harbors and marinas, and the repositioning of ships to deep waters when there is time to safely do so. Advisories are normally updated to continue the advisory, expand\/contract affected areas, upgrade to a warning, or cancel the advisory.<br \/><br \/><b>Tsunami Watch<\/b><br \/>-A tsunami watch is issued to alert emergency management officials and the public of an event which may later impact the watch area. The watch area may be upgraded to a warning or advisory - or canceled - based on updated information and analysis. Therefore, emergency management officials and the public should prepare to take action. Watches are normally issued based on seismic information without confirmation that a destructive tsunami is underway.<br \/><br \/><b>Tsunami Information Statement<\/b><br \/>-A tsunami information statement is issued to inform emergency manage\u00c2\u00adment officials and the public that an earthquake has occurred, or that a tsunami warning, advisory or watch has been issued for another section of the ocean. In most cases, information statements are issued to indicate there is no threat of a destructive tsunami and to prevent unnecessary evacuations as the earthquake may have been felt in coastal areas. An information statement may, in appropriate situations, caution about the possibility of destructive local tsunamis. Information statements may be re-issued with additional information, though normally these messages are not updated. However, a watch, advisory or warning may be issued for the area, if necessary, after analysis and\/or updated information becomes available.<br \/><br \/><b>During a Tsunami<\/b><br \/><br \/>-Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately. Take your animals with you.<br \/><br \/>-Move to high ground or inland and away from water immediately.<br \/><br \/>-Stay away from the beach. Never go down to the beach to watch a tsunami come in. If you can see the wave you are too close to escape it. CAUTION - If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline this is nature's tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately.<br \/><br \/>-Save yourself - not your possessions.<br \/><br \/>-Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and individuals with access or functional needs.<br \/><br \/><b>After a Tsunami<\/b><br \/><br \/>-Return home only after local officials tell you it is safe. A tsunami is a series of waves that may continue for hours. Do not assume that after one wave the danger is over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.<br \/><br \/>-Go to a designated public shelter if you have been told to evacuate or you feel it is unsafe to remain in your home. Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter in your area (example: shelter 12345).<br \/><br \/>-Avoid disaster areas. Your presence might interfere with emergency response operations and put you at further risk from the residual effects of floods.<br \/><br \/>-Stay away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to people or pets.<br \/>    <br \/>-Check yourself for injuries and get first aid as needed before helping injured or trapped persons.<br \/>    <br \/>-If someone needs to be rescued, call professionals with the right equipment to help. Many people have been killed or injured trying to rescue others.<br \/>    <br \/>-Help people who require special assistance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinfants, elderly people, those without transportation, people with access and functional needs and large families who may need additional help in an emergency situation.<br \/>    <br \/>-Continue using a NOAA Weather Radio or tuning to a Coast Guard station or a local radio or television station for the latest updates.<br \/>    <br \/>-Stay out of any building that has water around it. Tsunami water can cause floors to crack or walls to collapse.<br \/>    <br \/>-Use caution when re-entering buildings or homes. Tsunami-driven floodwater may have damaged buildings where you least expect it. Carefully watch every step you take.<br \/>    <br \/>-To avoid injury, wear protective clothing and be cautious when cleaning up."

    "description": "A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops in the western part of the North Pacific Ocean between 180\u00c2\u00b0 and 100\u00c2\u00b0E. This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin, and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth, accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones. For organizational purposes, the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to 140\u00c2\u00b0W), central (140\u00c2\u00b0 to 180\u00c2\u00b0W), and western (180\u00c2\u00b0 to 100\u00c2\u00b0E). The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan, with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii (the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), the Philippines and Hong Kong. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year. Only the Philippines use their own naming list for systems approaching the country.",

They are often referred to as twisters, whirlwinds or cyclones although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name any closed low pressure circulation",
    "Calamity_Tips": "-Identify a safe place in your home where household members and pets will gather during a tornado: a basement, storm cellar or an interior room on the lowest floor with no windows.<br \/><br \/>-  In a high-rise building, pick a hallway in the center of the building. You may not have enough time to go to the lowest floor. <br \/><br \/>-  In a mobile home, choose a safe place in a nearby sturdy building. If your mobile home park has a designated shelter, make it your safe place. No mobile home, however it is configured, is safe in a tornado.<br \/><br \/><b>Before a Tornado<\/b><br \/><br \/>-To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.<br \/><br \/>-Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or to commercial radio or television newscasts for the latest information.

Remain alert for approaching storms. Watch the sky and stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio or television for information.<br \/><br \/><b>Tornado Warning<\/b> <br \/>- A tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. Take shelter immediately.<br \/><br \/><b>During a Tornado<\/b><br \/><br \/>If you are under a tornado warning, seek shelter immediately!  Most injuries associated with high winds are from flying debris, so remember to protect your head.<br \/>If you are in:\tThen:<br \/>-A structure (e.g. residence, small building, school, nursing home, hospital, factory, shopping center, high-rise building)\t<br \/><br \/> -Go to a pre-designated area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of a small interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside. Get under a sturdy table and use your arms to protect your head and neck.<br \/><br \/>-In a high-rise building, go to a small interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible.<br \/>    Put on sturdy shoes.<br \/>    Do not open windows.<br \/><br \/><b>A manufactured home or office\t<\/b><br \/><br \/>-Get out immediately and go to a pre-identified location such as the lowest floor of a sturdy, nearby building or a storm shelter. Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes.<br \/><br \/><b>The outside with no shelter<\/b><br \/><br \/>-If you are not in a sturdy building, there is no single research-based recommendation for what last-resort action to take because many factors can affect your decision. Possible actions include:<br \/><br \/>-Immediately get into a vehicle, buckle your seat belt and try to drive to the closest sturdy shelter. If your vehicle is hit by flying debris while you are driving, pull over and park.<br \/><br \/>-Take cover in a stationary vehicle. Put the seat belt on and cover your head with your arms and a blanket, coat or other cushion if possible.<br \/><br \/>-Lie in an area noticeably lower than the level of the roadway and cover your head with your arms and a blanket, coat or other cushion if possible.<br \/><br \/><b>In all situations:<\/b><br \/><br \/>-Do not get under an overpass or bridge. You are safer in a low, flat location.<br \/><br \/>-Never try to outrun a tornado in urban or congested areas in a car or truck. Instead, leave the vehicle immediately for safe shelter.<br \/><br \/>-Watch out for flying debris. Flying debris from tornadoes causes most fatalities and injuries.<br \/><br \/><b>After a Tornado<\/b><br \/>-Listen to local officials for updates and instructions.<br \/>-Check-in with family and friends by texting or using social media.<br \/>-Watch out for debris and downed power lines.<br \/>-If you are trapped, do not move about or kick up dust. Tap on a pipe or wall or use a whistle, if you have one, so that rescuers can locate you.<br \/>-Stay out of damaged buildings and homes until local authorities indicate it is safe.<br \/>-Photograph the damage to your property in order to assist in filing an insurance claim.<br \/>-Do what you can to prevent further damage to your property, (e.g., putting a tarp on a damaged roof), as insurance may not cover additional damage that occurs after the storm.<br \/>-If your home is without power, use flashlights or battery-powered lanterns rather than candles to prevent accidental fires.<br \/><br \/><b>Build a Safe Room<\/b><br \/>-Extreme windstorms in many parts of the country pose a serious threat to buildings and their occupants. Your residence may be built \"to code\" but that does not mean it can withstand winds from extreme events such as tornadoes and major hurricanes. The purpose of a safe room or a wind shelter is to provide a space where you and your family can seek refuge that provides a high level of protection. You can build a safe room in one of several places in your home.<br \/><br \/>    Your basement<br \/>    Atop a concrete slab-on-grade foundation or garage floor.<br \/>    An interior room on the first floor.<br \/><br \/>Safe rooms built below ground level provide the greatest protection, but a safe room built in a first-floor interior room also can provide the necessary protection. Below-ground safe rooms must be designed to avoid accumulating water during the heavy rains that often accompany severe windstorms.<br \/><br \/>-To protect its occupants, a safe room must be built to withstand high winds and flying debris, even if the rest of the residence is severely damaged or destroyed. Consider the following when building a safe room:<br \/><br \/>-The safe room must be adequately anchored to resist overturning and uplift.<br \/>-The walls, ceiling and door of the shelter must withstand wind pressure and resist penetration by windborne objects and falling debris.<br \/>-The connections between all parts of the safe room must be strong enough to resist the wind.<br \/>-Sections of either interior or exterior residence walls that are used as walls of the safe room must be separated from the structure of the residence so that damage to the residence will not cause damage to the safe room.<br \/><br \/>"

    "description": "Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick a little. They don't just slide smoothly; the rocks catch on each other. The rocks are still pushing against each other, but not moving. After a while, the rocks break because of all the pressure that's built up. When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs. During the earthquake and afterward, the plates or blocks of rock start moving, and they continue to move until they get stuck again. The spot underground where the rock breaks is called the focus of the earthquake. The place right above the focus (on top of the ground) is called the epicenter of the earthquake.",

The risk of active TB is also greater in persons suffering from other conditions that impair the immune system.<br \/>One million children (0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 years of age) fell ill with TB, and 170 000 children (excluding children with HIV) died from the disease in 2015.<br \/>Tobacco use greatly increases the risk of TB disease and death. More than 20% of TB cases worldwide are attributable to smoking.<br \/><br \/><b>Global impact of TB<\/b><br \/>TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2015, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in Asia, with 61% of new cases, followed by Africa, with 26% of new cases.<br \/>In 2015, 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries. Six countries accounted for 60% of the new TB cases: India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa. Global progress depends on advances in TB prevention and care in these countries.<br \/><br \/><b>Symptoms and diagnosis<\/b><br \/>Common symptoms of active lung TB are cough with sputum and blood at times, chest pains, weakness, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Many countries still rely on a long-used method called sputum smear microscopy to diagnose TB. Trained laboratory technicians look at sputum samples under a microscope to see if TB bacteria are present. Microscopy detects only half the number of TB cases and cannot detect drug-resistance.<br \/>The use of the rapid test Xpert MTB\/RIF\u00c2\u00ae has expanded substantially since 2010, when WHO first recommended its use. The test simultaneously detects TB and resistance to rifampicin, the most important TB medicine. Diagnosis can be made within 2 hours and the test is now recommended by WHO as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB. More than 100 countries are already using the test and 6.2 million cartridges were procured globally in 2015.<br \/>Diagnosing multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (see Multidrug-resistant TB section below) as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive. In 2016, 4 new diagnostic tests were recommended by WHO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rapid molecular test to detect TB at peripheral health centres where Xpert MTB\/RIF cannot be used, and 3 tests to detect resistance to first- and second-line TB medicines.<br \/>Tuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children and as yet only the Xpert MTB\/RIF assay is generally available to assist with the diagnosis of paediatric TB.<br \/><br \/><b>Treatment<\/b><br \/>TB is a treatable and curable disease. Active, drug-susceptible TB disease is treated with a standard 6 month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs that are provided with information, supervision and support to the patient by a health worker or trained volunteer. Without such support, treatment adherence can be difficult and the disease can spread. The vast majority of TB cases can be cured when medicines are provided and taken properly.<br \/>Between 2000 and 2015, an estimated 49 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment.<br \/><br \/><b>Multidrug-resistant TB<\/b><br \/>Anti-TB medicines have been used for decades and strains that are resistant to 1 or more of the medicines have been documented in every country surveyed. Drug resistance emerges when anti-TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, and patients stopping treatment prematurely.<br \/>Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most powerful, first-line anti-TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs. However, second-line treatment options are limited and require extensive chemotherapy (up to 2 years of treatment) with medicines that are expensive and toxic.<br \/>In some cases, more severe drug resistance can develop. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a more serious form of MDR-TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line anti-TB drugs, often leaving patients without any further treatment options.<br \/>About 480 000 people worldwide developed MDR-TB in 2015. In addition, around 100 000 people developed resistance to rifampicin (the most effective first-line medicine) and needed MDR-TB treatment. The MDR-TB burden largely falls on 3 countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China, India, and the Russian Federation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which together account for nearly half of the global cases. About 9.5% of MDR-TB cases had XDR-TB in 2015.<br \/>Worldwide, only 52% of MDR-TB patients and 28% of XDR-TB are currently successfully treated. In 2016, WHO approved the use of a short, standardised regimen for MDR-TB patients who do not have strains that are resistant to second-line TB medicines. This regimen takes 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 months and is much less expensive than the conventional treatment for MDR-TB, which can take up to 2 years. Patients with XDR-TB or resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs cannot use this regimen, however, and need to be put on longer MDR-TB regimens to which 1 of the new drugs (bedquiline and delamanid) may be added.<br \/>WHO also approved in 2016 a rapid diagnostic test to quickly identify these patients. More than 20 countries in Africa and Asia have started using shorter MDR-TB regimens. By the end of 2015, 70 countries had introduced bedaquiline and 39 countries had introduced delamanid, in an effort to improve the effectiveness of MDR-TB treatment regimens.<br \/>"

    "description": "Epilepsy-is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Many people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure and may have other symptoms of neurological problems as well. <br \/><br \/>Sometimes EEG testing, clinical history, family history and outlook are similar among a group of people with epilepsy. In these situations, their condition can be defined as a specific epilepsy syndrome. The human brain is the source of human epilepsy. Although the symptoms of a seizure may affect any part of the body, the electrical events that produce the symptoms occur in the brain. The location of that event, how it spreads and how much of the brain is affected, and how long it lasts all have profound effects. These factors determine the character of a seizure and its impact on the individual. Esssentially, anything the brain can do, it can do in the form of a seizure. <br \/>Having seizures and epilepsy can affect one's safety, relationships, work, driving and so much more. Public perception and treatment of people with epilepsy are often bigger problems than actual seizures.",
    "disease_seemore": "<b>Symptoms<\/b><br \/>Seizures are the main symptom of epilepsy.

This type of seizure may also cause repetitive movements like lip smacking or blinking. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also usually a short loss of awareness.<br \/><br \/>Tonic seizures -cause muscle stiffness.<br \/><br \/>Atonic seizures<br \/>-lead to loss of muscle control and can make you fall down suddenly.<br \/><br \/><b>What causes epilepsy?<\/b><br \/>For 6 out of 10 people with epilepsy, the cause can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be determined. <br \/>A variety of things can lead to seizures.<br \/>Possible causes include:<br \/>-Traumatic Brain Injury<br \/>-Scarring on the brain after a brain injury (post-traumatic epilepsy) <br \/>-Serious illness or very high fever<br \/>-Stroke, which is a leading cause of epilepsy in people over age 35<br \/>-Other vascular diseases<br \/>-Lack of oxygen to the brain<br \/>-Brain tumor or cyst<br \/>-Dementia or Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease<br \/>-Maternal drug use, Prenatal Injury, Brain<br \/>-Malformation, or Lack of Oxygen at birth<br \/>-Infectious diseases such as AIDS and Meningitis<br \/>-Genetic or Developmental Disorders or<br \/>-Neurological Diseases<br \/><br \/><b>How is epilepsy treated?<\/b><br \/>Most people can manage epilepsy. <br \/>Your treatment plan will be based on severity of symptoms, your health, and how well you respond to therapy.<br \/>Some treatment options include:<br \/><b>Anti-epileptic (anticonvulsant, antiseizure) drugs<\/b><br \/>- These medications can reduce the number of seizures you have. In some people, they eliminate seizures. To be effective, the medication must be taken exactly as prescribed.<br \/><br \/><b>Vagus nerve stimulator<\/b><br \/>-This device is surgically placed under the skin on the chest and electrically stimulates the nerve that runs through your neck. This can help prevent seizures.<br \/><br \/><b>Ketogenic diet<\/b><br \/>-More than half of people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond to medication benefit from this high fat, low carbohydrate diet.<br \/><br \/><b>Brain surgery<\/b><br \/>-The area of the brain that causes seizure activity can be removed or altered.<br \/>- One treatment that may be available in the future is deep brain stimulation- It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a procedure in which electrodes are implanted into your brain. <br \/>Then a generator is implanted in your chest.
