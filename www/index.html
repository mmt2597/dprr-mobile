                                                <span class="gk">A Tsunami , also known as a seismic sea wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Unlike normal ocean waves which are generated by wind, or tides which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water.<br></span>

                                                <span class="gk"><b>Before a Tsunami</b><br><br>The following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property from the effects of a tsunami:<br><br>-To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.<br><br>-Talk to everyone in your household about what to do if a tsunami occurs. Create and practice an evacuation plan for your family. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at night and during inclement weather. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking during an actual emergency.<br><br>-If the school evacuation plan requires you to pick your children up from school or from another location. Be aware telephone lines during a tsunami alert may be overloaded and routes to and from schools may be jammed.<br><br>-Knowing your community's warning systems and disaster plans, including evacuation routes.<br><br>-If you are a tourist, familiarize yourself with local tsunami evacuation protocols. If you are concerned that you will not be able to reach a safe place in time, ask your local emergency management office about vertical evacuation. Some strong (e.g., reinforced concrete) and tall buildings may be able to provide protection if no other options are available.<br><br>-If an earthquake occurs and you are in a coastal area, turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning.<br><br><b>Tsunami Warning</b><br>-A tsunami warning is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate widespread inundation is imminent or expected. Warnings alert the public that dangerous coastal flooding accompanied by powerful curÃ‚&shy;rents is possible and may continue for several hours after initial arrival. Warnings alert emergency management officials to take action for the entire tsunami hazard zone. Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include the evacuation of low-lying coastal areas, and the repositioning of ships to deep waters when there is time to safely do so. Warnings may be updated, adjusted geographically, downgraded, or canceled. <br>To provide the earliest possible alert, initial warnings are normally based only on seismic information.<br><br><b>Tsunami Advisory</b><br>-A tsunami advisory is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is imminent or expected. The threat may continue for several hours after initial arrival, but significant inundation is not expected for areas under an advisory. Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include closing beaches, evacuating harbors and marinas, and the repositioning of ships to deep waters when there is time to safely do so. Advisories are normally updated to continue the advisory, expand/contract affected areas, upgrade to a warning, or cancel the advisory.<br><br><b>Tsunami Watch</b><br>-A tsunami watch is issued to alert emergency management officials and the public of an event which may later impact the watch area. The watch area may be upgraded to a warning or advisory - or canceled - based on updated information and analysis. Therefore, emergency management officials and the public should prepare to take action. Watches are normally issued based on seismic information without confirmation that a destructive tsunami is underway.<br><br><b>Tsunami Information Statement</b><br>-A tsunami information statement is issued to inform emergency manageÂment officials and the public that an earthquake has occurred, or that a tsunami warning, advisory or watch has been issued for another section of the ocean. In most cases, information statements are issued to indicate there is no threat of a destructive tsunami and to prevent unnecessary evacuations as the earthquake may have been felt in coastal areas. An information statement may, in appropriate situations, caution about the possibility of destructive local tsunamis. Information statements may be re-issued with additional information, though normally these messages are not updated. However, a watch, advisory or warning may be issued for the area, if necessary, after analysis and/or updated information becomes available.<br><br><b>During a Tsunami</b><br><br>-Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately. Take your animals with you.<br><br>-Move to high ground or inland and away from water immediately.<br><br>-Stay away from the beach. Never go down to the beach to watch a tsunami come in. If you can see the wave you are too close to escape it. CAUTION - If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline this is nature's tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately.<br><br>-Save yourself - not your possessions.<br><br>-Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and individuals with access or functional needs.<br><br><b>After a Tsunami</b><br><br>-Return home only after local officials tell you it is safe. A tsunami is a series of waves that may continue for hours. Do not assume that after one wave the danger is over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.<br><br>-Go to a designated public shelter if you have been told to evacuate or you feel it is unsafe to remain in your home. Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter in your area (example: shelter 12345).<br><br>-Avoid disaster areas. Your presence might interfere with emergency response operations and put you at further risk from the residual effects of floods.<br><br>-Stay away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to people or pets.<br>    <br>-Check yourself for injuries and get first aid as needed before helping injured or trapped persons.<br>    <br>-If someone needs to be rescued, call professionals with the right equipment to help. Many people have been killed or injured trying to rescue others.<br>    <br>-Help people who require special assistance" infants, elderly people, those without transportation, people with access and functional needs and large families who may need additional help in an emergency situation.<br>    <br>-Continue using a NOAA Weather Radio or tuning to a Coast Guard station or a local radio or television station for the latest updates.<br>    <br>-Stay out of any building that has water around it. Tsunami water can cause floors to crack or walls to collapse.<br>    <br>-Use caution when re-entering buildings or homes. Tsunami-driven floodwater may have damaged buildings where you least expect it. Carefully watch every step you take.<br>    <br>-To avoid injury, wear protective clothing and be cautious when cleaning up.</span>

                                                <span class="gk">A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops in the western part of the North Pacific Ocean between 180° and 100°E. This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin, and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth, accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones. For organizational purposes, the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to 140°W), central (140° to 180°W), and western (180° to 100°E). The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan, with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii (the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), the Philippines and Hong Kong. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year. Only the Philippines use their own naming list for systems approaching the country.</span>

You may not have enough time to go to the lowest floor. <br><br>-  In a mobile home, choose a safe place in a nearby sturdy building. If your mobile home park has a designated shelter, make it your safe place. No mobile home, however it is configured, is safe in a tornado.<br><br><b>Before a Tornado</b><br><br>-To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.<br><br>-Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or to commercial radio or television newscasts for the latest information. In any emergency, always listen to the instructions given by local emergency management officials.<br><br>-Be alert to changing weather conditions. Look for approaching storms.<br>    <br><b>Look for the following danger signs:</b><br>-Dark, often greenish sky<br>-Large hail<br>-A large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating)<br>-Loud roar, similar to a freight train.<br>-If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately.<br><br><b>Know the Terms</b><br><br>Familiarize yourself with these terms to help identify a tornado hazard:<br><br><b>Tornado Watch</b><br> - Tornadoes are possible. Remain alert for approaching storms. Watch the sky and stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio or television for information.<br><br><b>Tornado Warning</b> <br>- A tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. Take shelter immediately.<br><br><b>During a Tornado</b><br><br>If you are under a tornado warning, seek shelter immediately!  Most injuries associated with high winds are from flying debris, so remember to protect your head.<br>If you are in:  Then:<br>-A structure (e.g. residence, small building, school, nursing home, hospital, factory, shopping center, high-rise building)  <br><br> -Go to a pre-designated area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of a small interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside. Get under a sturdy table and use your arms to protect your head and neck.<br><br>-In a high-rise building, go to a small interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible.<br>    Put on sturdy shoes.<br>    Do not open windows.<br><br><b>A manufactured home or office </b><br><br>-Get out immediately and go to a pre-identified location such as the lowest floor of a sturdy, nearby building or a storm shelter. Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes.<br><br><b>The outside with no shelter</b><br><br>-If you are not in a sturdy building, there is no single research-based recommendation for what last-resort action to take because many factors can affect your decision. Possible actions include:<br><br>-Immediately get into a vehicle, buckle your seat belt and try to drive to the closest sturdy shelter. If your vehicle is hit by flying debris while you are driving, pull over and park.<br><br>-Take cover in a stationary vehicle. Put the seat belt on and cover your head with your arms and a blanket, coat or other cushion if possible.<br><br>-Lie in an area noticeably lower than the level of the roadway and cover your head with your arms and a blanket, coat or other cushion if possible.<br><br><b>In all situations:</b><br><br>-Do not get under an overpass or bridge. You are safer in a low, flat location.<br><br>-Never try to outrun a tornado in urban or congested areas in a car or truck. Instead, leave the vehicle immediately for safe shelter.<br><br>-Watch out for flying debris. Flying debris from tornadoes causes most fatalities and injuries.<br><br><b>After a Tornado</b><br>-Listen to local officials for updates and instructions.<br>-Check-in with family and friends by texting or using social media.<br>-Watch out for debris and downed power lines.<br>-If you are trapped, do not move about or kick up dust. Tap on a pipe or wall or use a whistle, if you have one, so that rescuers can locate you.<br>-Stay out of damaged buildings and homes until local authorities indicate it is safe.<br>-Photograph the damage to your property in order to assist in filing an insurance claim.<br>-Do what you can to prevent further damage to your property, (e.g., putting a tarp on a damaged roof), as insurance may not cover additional damage that occurs after the storm.<br>-If your home is without power, use flashlights or battery-powered lanterns rather than candles to prevent accidental fires.<br><br><b>Build a Safe Room</b><br>-Extreme windstorms in many parts of the country pose a serious threat to buildings and their occupants. Your residence may be built "to code" but that does not mean it can withstand winds from extreme events such as tornadoes and major hurricanes. The purpose of a safe room or a wind shelter is to provide a space where you and your family can seek refuge that provides a high level of protection. You can build a safe room in one of several places in your home.<br><br>    Your basement<br>    Atop a concrete slab-on-grade foundation or garage floor.<br>    An interior room on the first floor.<br><br>Safe rooms built below ground level provide the greatest protection, but a safe room built in a first-floor interior room also can provide the necessary protection. Below-ground safe rooms must be designed to avoid accumulating water during the heavy rains that often accompany severe windstorms.<br><br>-To protect its occupants, a safe room must be built to withstand high winds and flying debris, even if the rest of the residence is severely damaged or destroyed. Consider the following when building a safe room:<br><br>-The safe room must be adequately anchored to resist overturning and uplift.<br>-The walls, ceiling and door of the shelter must withstand wind pressure and resist penetration by windborne objects and falling debris.<br>-The connections between all parts of the safe room must be strong enough to resist the wind.<br>-Sections of either interior or exterior residence walls that are used as walls of the safe room must be separated from the structure of the residence so that damage to the residence will not cause damage to the safe room.<br><br></span>

                                                <span class="gk">Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick a little. They don't just slide smoothly; the rocks catch on each other. The rocks are still pushing against each other, but not moving. After a while, the rocks break because of all the pressure that's built up. When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs. During the earthquake and afterward, the plates or blocks of rock start moving, and they continue to move until they get stuck again. The spot underground where the rock breaks is called the focus of the earthquake. The place right above the focus (on top of the ground) is called the epicenter of the earthquake.</span>

Foreshocks and aftershocks can occur for days, weeks and months of a main earthquake.<br>Earthquakes are also called temblors. <br><br>- Have an earthquake readiness plan.<br>- Consult a professional to learn how to make your home sturdier, such as bolting bookcases to wall studs, installing strong latches on cupboards, and strapping the water heater to wall studs.<br>- Locate a place in each room of the house that you can go to in case of an earthquake. It should be a spot where nothing is likely to fall on you, like a doorframe.<br>- Keep a supply of canned food, an up-to-date first aid kit, 3 gallons (11.4 liters) of water per person, dust masks and goggles, and a working battery-operated radio and flashlights in an accessible place.<br>- Know how to turn off your gas and water mains.<br><br><b>IF SHAKING BEGINS</b><br>- Drop down; take cover under a desk or table and hold on.<br>- Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you're sure it's safe to exit.<br>- Stay away from bookcases or furniture that can fall on you.<br></span>

In less than 30 seconds a small flame can get completely out of control and turn into a major fire. It only takes minutes for thick black smoke to fill a house or for it to be engulfed in flames. Most deadly fires occur in the home when people are asleep. If you wake up to a fire, you won't have time to grab valuables because fire spreads too quickly and the smoke is too thick. There is only time to escape.<br><br><b>Fire is HOT!</b><br>Heat is more threatening than flames. A fire's heat alone can kill. Room temperatures in a fire can be 100 degrees at floor level and rise to 600 degrees at eye level. Inhaling this super-hot air will scorch your lungs. This heat can melt clothes to your skin. In five minutes, a room can get so hot that everything in it ignites at once: this is called flashover.<br><br><b>Fire is DARK!</b><br>Fire isn't bright, it's pitch black. Fire starts bright, but quickly produces black smoke and complete darkness. If you wake up to a fire you may be blinded, disoriented and unable to find your way around the home you've lived in for years.<br><br><b>Fire is DEADLY!</b><br>Smoke and toxic gases kill more people than flames do. Fire uses up the oxygen you need and produces smoke and poisonous gases that kill. Breathing even small amounts of smoke and toxic gases can make you drowsy, disoriented and short of breath. The odorless, colorless fumes can lull you into a deep sleep before the flames reach your door. You may not wake up in time to escape.<br>Only when we know the true nature of fire can we prepare our families and ourselves.<br></span>

                                                <span class="gk">In simple terms, a landslide is a massive movement of rock, soil, debris or earth material downwards along a hill or slope due to the force of gravity. The movement may be flowing, spreading, falling, toppling, sliding and so on. This can be dry debris movement or water saturated (muddy) earth material.<br><br><b>Landslide Ffact Slope:</b><br>Landslides and mudflows flow faster on steeper slopes and may be more destructive.<br><br><b>Landslide Fact Water:</b><br>When more water accompanies landslides, they travel farther and faster. More water is even more destructive as the pressure and power of its eroding force are more.<br><br><b>Landslide Fact Earth movements:</b><br>Generally, hills and mountains stay in place if nothing bothers them. When earthquakes, tremors, and volcanoes occur, they shake the land and disturbs the boding of the bedrock. When this happens, landslides are ripe.<br></span>

If you travel or are on vacation somewhere, look around and make sure you understand where the threat may be. Look out for slopes and tricky landscapes. Contact your local authorities and tell them about your observations.<br><br>-When you drive around hills or mountains, keep your eyes and ears open for signs of debris falling.

Talk to neighbors and discuss an escape plan. If possible, evacuate before it happens.<br><br><b>During a landslide:</b><br>-Landslides and mudslides happen very fast and there may be very little time to act. Move away quickly from the path of the mudflow or landslide to another location. Do not try to stay close and take photographs. Landslide debris move from uphill to downhill, therefore, avoid low-lying areas or valleys. If there is a way to sound an alarm, do so.<br><br>-Listen and look out for signs of further flows in that area, as the flowing debris often knock against surrounding slopes and sets off new flows.<br><br><b>After a landslide:</b><br><br>-Stay away from the location until the emergency workers and the experts confirm that it is safe to go back. Look out for loose wires, broken utility lines, and hanging objects, as they may be hazards. Report them to your rescue officials. Get in touch with emergency officials or listen to the radio or TV on what to do.<br></span>

                                                <span class="gk">Volcano Eruptions<br>-can be in the form of lava fragments shooting into the atmosphere and forming thick clouds of lava. Some also flow slowly (non-violent) from the vent, flooding the area around it. Very fine particles of ash may also be discharged high into the stratosphere and further carried away by wind action.<br><br>Fresh lava is believed to be about 2,200°F. It can be red hot as it shoots from the vent and turn into gray or black as it cools. Lava rich in silicon is like honey, and flows a lot more slowly from the vent. In other types, lava also comes in thick, pasty form.<br><br><b>Types of volcanic eruptions</b><br><br>Lava and other volcanic matter are expelled in many distinctive ways.  These ways were named after the manner in which some well-known volcanoes gave out lava. These are as follow:<br><br>Volcano Strombolian eruption<br>-In this eruption, clots of molten lava burst from the vent (summit) into the sky. It looks like fireworks, displaying luminous arcs or fire. It was observed during an eruption of Iruzu volcano in Costa Rica in 1965.<br><br>Volcano Vulcanian Eruption<br>-This involves the expulsion of ash-laden gas from the peak, forming whitish clouds of ash at the top of the cone. This type was observed in an eruption of ParÃƒ&shy;cutinin 1947.<br><br>Volcano Vesuvian Eruption<br>-Here, ash-laden gas gushes out violently, forming thick cauli-flower shapes of ash-clouds. It was observed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy, in the year 79 A.D<br><br>Volcano Peléan / Nuée Ardente Eruption Ardente Eruption<br>-Here, incandescent lava, together with ash and gas are blown out from the crater, vertically upwards and falling in again. The spilling of glowing avalanches along the slopes can be very deadly and destructive. This type of eruption occurred on the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1968<br><br>Volcano Hawaiian eruption:<br>-As observed with Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii, 1950, this eruption occurs along a fracture (linear vent) with burning lava sprouting from the fracture. It can also occur in a central vent, in which case incandescent lava gushes out in the form of a fountain.<br><br>Volcano Phreatic ((say free-a-tic) Eruption<br>-This type does not involve the outpour of lava, but usually set off when cold ground or water comes into contact with hot molten matter. The resulting steam that is forced upwards usually contains debris of surface rocks. No new magma is erupted.<br><br>Volcano Plinian Eruption<br>-This eruption type ejects massive viscous lava, with gases and ash, miles into the air. The light nature of the lava is carried miles away by the wind action, and tends to spread many miles from the eruption point.<br></span>

Assemble and maintain yourEmergency Survival Items for your home as well as a portable getaway kit.<br>Include your pets and livestock in your emergency plan.<br> <br><b>WHEN A VOLCANIC ERUPTION THREATENS</b><br>-Listen to your local radio stations as emergency management officials will be broadcasting the most appropriate advice for your community and situation.<br>-Put your emergency plan into action.<br>-If you have a disability or need assistance, make contact with your support network and keep informed of civil defence advice.<br>-Put all machinery inside a garage or shed, or cover with large tarpaulins to protect them from volcanic ash.<br>-Bring animals and livestock into closed shelters to protect them from volcanic ash.<br>-Protect sensitive electronics and do not uncover until the environment is totally ash-free.<br>-Check on friends and neighbours who may require special assistance.<br> <br><b>DURING A VOLCANIC ERUPTION</b><br>-Listen to the radio for civil defence advice and follow instructions.<br>-If outside at the time of eruption, seek shelter in a car or a building. If caught in volcanic ashfalls, wear a dust mask or use a handkerchief or cloth over your nose and mouth.<br>-Stay indoors as volcanic ash is a health hazard, especially if you have respiratory difficulties such as asthma or bronchitis.<br>-When indoors, close all windows and doors to limit the entry of volcanic ash. Place damp towels at thresholds.<br>-Do not tie up phone lines with non-emergency calls.<br>-If you have to go outside use protective gear such as masks and goggles and keep as much of your skin covered as possible. Wear eyeglasses, not contact lenses as these can cause corneal abrasions.<br>-Disconnect drainpipes/downspouts from gutters to stop drains clogging. If you use a rainwater collection system for your water supply, disconnect the tank.<br>-Stay out of designated restricted zones.<br> <br><b>AFTER A VOLCANIC ERUPTION</b><br>-Listen to your local radio stations for civil defence advice and follow instructions.<br>-Stay indoors and away from volcanic ashfall areas as much as possible.<br>-When it is safe to go outside, keep your gutters and roof clear of ash as heavy ash deposits can collapse your roof.<br>-If there is a lot of ash in the water supply, do not use your dishwasher or washing machine.<br>-Avoid driving in heavy ashfall as it stirs up ash that can clog engines and cause serious abrasion damage to your vehie.<br>-Keep animals indoors where possible, wash away ash on their paws or skin to keep them from ingesting the ash, and provide clean drinking water.<br>-Use a mask or a damp cloth and eye protection when cleaning up. Moisten the ash with a sprinkler before cleaning.<br>-Look for and report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.<br>-If your property is damaged, take notes and photographs for insurance purposes. If you rent your property, contact your landlord and your contents insurance company as soon as possible.<br></span>

                                        <p>FIRST AID is the assistance given to any person suffering a sudden illness or injury,with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, and/or promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing CPR while awaiting an ambulance, as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut. FIRST AID is generally performed by the layperson, with many people trained in providing basic levels of FIRST AID, and others willing to do so from acquired knowledge. Mental health FIRST AID is an extension of the concept of FIRST AID to cover mental health.</p>

                                        <p>Epilepsy-is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Many people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure and may have other symptoms of neurological problems as well. <br><br>Sometimes EEG testing, clinical history, family history and outlook are similar among a group of people with epilepsy. In these situations, their condition can be defined as a specific epilepsy syndrome. The human brain is the source of human epilepsy. Although the symptoms of a seizure may affect any part of the body, the electrical events that produce the symptoms occur in the brain. The location of that event, how it spreads and how much of the brain is affected, and how long it lasts all have profound effects. These factors determine the character of a seizure and its impact on the individual. Esssentially, anything the brain can do, it can do in the form of a seizure. <br>Having seizures and epilepsy can affect one's safety, relationships, work, driving and so much more. Public perception and treatment of people with epilepsy are often bigger problems than actual seizures.</p>

                                        <p>Fever is often a sign of infection, inflammation, or illness. It occurs when temperature rises above 37.7 degrees celsius. A "significant fever" is usually defined as an oral or ear temperature of 39 degrees celsius. Most cases of fever are self-limiting.<br>Doctors may recommend fever-reducing medicines only when the temperature is at 38.8 degrees celsius. Otherwise, supportive treatments are recommended. On the other hand, the underlying cause of the fever (for example, infection) should be treated. Antibiotics are given to eradicate the infection thus, lowering the fever.</p>

Three-quarters of these deaths happen within the first week of life. Lack of skilled medical care makes this a huge problem in developing countries. Many newborn deaths could be avoided with good prenatal and postnatal care.</p>

                                        <p>Diabetes is a group of diseases that affect insulin production and use. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas can no longer produce insulin. The cause is not known. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas doesnt produce enough insulin, or it cant be used effectively. Type 2 diabetes can be caused by a number of factors, including poor diet, lack of exercise, and carrying too much weight.<br><br>In 2012, about 1.5 million people died from diabetes-related causes, according to WHO. People in low to middle income countries are more likely to die from complications of diabetes.</p>

                                        <p> Diarrhea is when you pass three or more loose stools a day. When diarrhea lasts more than a few days, your body loses too much water and salt. Death is due to dehydration. Diarrhea is usually caused by an intestinal infection transmitted through viruses, bacteria, or even parasites. This type of infection can easily spread through contaminated water or food. Its particularly widespread in developing nations that have poor sanitary conditions.<br><br>WHO estimates that 1.5 million people died from diarrheal diseases in 2012, which comprises about 2.7 percent of deaths. Fortunately, thats down from 2.2 million in 2000. Diarrheal disease is the second top killer of children under age five. Tragically, about 760,000 children die from diarrheal diseases each year.</p>

Each time the heart beats; it pumps blood into the vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump.</p>

                                        <p>Usually referred to as the flu or grippe, influenza is a highly infectious respiratory disease. The disease is caused bycertain strains of the influenza virus. When the virus is inhaled, it attacks cells in the upper respiratory tract, causingtypical flu symptoms such as fatigue, fever and chills, a hacking cough, and body aches. Influenza victims are alsosusceptible to potentially life-threatening secondary infections. Although the stomach or intestinal "flu" is commonlyblamed for stomach upsets and diarrhea, the influenza virus rarely causes gastrointestinal symptoms. Such symptomsare most likely due to other organisms such as rotavirus, Salmonella, Shigella, or Escherichia coli.</p>

Oxygen-deprived brain cells begin to die within minutes.<br><br>Stroke was responsible for 6.7 million deaths around the world in 2012, according to WHO. That figure represents about 11.9 percent of all deaths. CDC figures show that nearly 130,000 people in the United States die of stroke each year that one person every four minutes. About one in four strokes occur in people who have had a prior stroke. Stroke is also a leading cause of disability.<br><br>Risk factors for stroke are similar to those for CAD. In general, good health habits can lower your risks.</p>

CAD, also called ischemic heart disease, occurs when the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart become narrowed. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 7.4 million people died of ischemic heart disease in 2012. That was about 13.2 percent of all deaths.<br><br>In the United States, about 600,000 people die of heart disease every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That makes it the deadliest disease in the U.S., as well as the world. In the U.S. the most common type of heart disease is CAD, which takes about 380,000 lives each year.</p>

            <h4>Coronary Artery Disease (IHD)</h4>
               <p>Ischemic Heart Disease(IHD)<br>Among the risk factors are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Regular exercise, good nutrition, and weight control can help lower your risk of developing CAD.<br><br>Where you live matters. Although it's still the leading cause of death, mortality rates have declined in many European countries and in the United States. This may be due to better prevention and access to quality healthcare. However, in many developing nations, mortality rates due to CAD are on the rise.<br><br><b>Symptoms</b><br><br><br><br>If your coronary arteries narrow, they can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart especially when it's beating hard, such as during exercise. At first, the decreased blood flow may not cause any coronary artery disease symptoms. As plaque continues to build up in your coronary arteries, however, you may develop coronary artery disease signs and symptoms, including:<br><br><br><br><br><b>Chest pain (angina)</b>: You may feel pressure or tightness in your chest, as if someone were standing on your chest. This pain, referred to as angina, usually occurs on the middle or left side of the chest. Angina is generally triggered by physical or emotional stress.<br><br><br>The pain usually goes away within minutes after stopping the stressful activity. In some people, especially women, this pain may be fleeting or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back.<br><br><br><br><b>Shortness of breath</b>: If your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue with exertion.<br><br><br><b>Heart attack</b>: A completely blocked coronary artery may cause a heart attack. The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing pressure in your chest and pain in your shoulder or arm, sometimes with shortness of breath and sweating.<br><br><br><br>Women are somewhat more likely than men are to experience less typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as neck or jaw pain. Sometimes a heart attack occurs without any apparent signs or symptoms.<br><br>Treatments for Coronary Artery Disease usually involves lifestyle changes and, if necessary, drugs and certain medical procedures.<br><br><br><br>Lifestyle changes<br><br>Making a commitment to the following healthy lifestyle changes can go a long way toward promoting healthier arteries:<br><br></p>

            <h4>Stroke</h4>
               <p><b>Hemorrhagic stroke</b><br>-Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), overtreatment with anticoagulants and weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms).<br><br>A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation) present at birth.<br><br><b>Types of hemorrhagic stroke include:</b><br><br>-<b>Intracerebral hemorrhage</b><br>-In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue, damaging brain cells. Brain cells beyond the leak are deprived of blood and also damaged. High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage.<br><br>-<b> Subarachnoid hemorrhage</b><br>-In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, an artery on or near the surface of your brain bursts and spills into the space between the surface of your brain and your skull. This bleeding is often signaled by a sudden, severe headache.<br><br>A subarachnoid hemorrhage is commonly caused by the bursting of a small sack-shaped or berry-shaped outpouching on an artery known as an aneurysm. After the hemorrhage, the blood vessels in your brain may widen and narrow erratically (vasospasm), causing brain cell damage by further limiting blood flow.<br><br><b>SYMPTOMS: </b><br><br>-Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg, especially on one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Similarly, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.<br><br>-Trouble with seeing in one or both eyes. You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.<br><br>-Headache. A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate you're having a stroke.<br><br>-Trouble with walking. You may stumble or experience sudden dizziness, loss of balance or loss of coordination.<br><br>-Trouble with speaking and understanding. You may experience confusion. You may slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech. <br><br><b>Treatments</b><br><br>Emergency treatment of hemorrhagic stroke focuses on controlling your bleeding and reducing pressure in your brain. Surgery also may be performed to help reduce future risk.<br><br><b>Emergency measures:</b><br>If you take warfarin (Coumadin) or anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix) to prevent blood clots, you may be given drugs or transfusions of blood products to counteract the blood thinners' effects.<br><br>You may also be given drugs to lower pressure in your brain (intracranial pressure), lower your blood pressure, prevent vasospasm or prevent seizures.<br><br>Once the bleeding in your brain stops, treatment usually involves supportive medical care while your body absorbs the blood. Healing is similar to what happens while a bad bruise goes away. If the area of bleeding is large, your doctor may perform surgery to remove the blood and relieve pressure on your brain.<br><br><b>Surgical blood vessel repair</b><br>-Surgery may be used to repair blood vessel abnormalities associated with hemorrhagic strokes.<br>Your doctor may recommend one of these procedures after a stroke or if an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or other type of vascular malformation caused your hemorrhagic stroke:<br>-<b>Surgical clipping</b><br>- A surgeon places a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm, to stop blood flow to it. This clamp can keep the aneurysm from bursting, or it can prevent re-bleeding of an aneurysm that has recently hemorrhaged.<br><br>-<b>Coiling (endovascular embolization)</b>-In this procedure, a surgeon inserts a catheter into an artery in your groin and guides it to your brain using X-ray imaging. Your surgeon then guides tiny detachable coils into the aneurysm (aneurysm coiling). The coils fill the aneurysm, which blocks blood flow into the aneurysm and causes the blood to clot.<br><br>-<b>Surgical AVM removal</b><br>- Surgeons may remove a smaller AVM if it's located in an accessible area of your brain, to eliminate the risk of rupture and lower the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. However, it's not always possible to remove an AVM if its removal would cause too large a reduction in brain function, or if it's large or located deep within your brain.<br><br>-<b>Intracranial by pass</b><br>- In some unique circumstances, surgical bypass of intracranial blood vessels may be an option to treat poor blood flow to a region of the brain or complex vascular lesions, such as aneurysm repair.<br><br>-<b>Stereotactic radiosurgery</b><br>- Using multiple beams of highly focused radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery is an advanced minimally invasive treatment used to repair vascular malformations.<br><br><b>Ischemic strokes</b><br>-Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia).<br><br><b>The most common ischemic strokes include:</b><br><br>-<b>Thrombotic stroke:</b><br>-A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain. A clot may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other artery conditions.<br><br>-<b>Embolic stroke</b><br>-An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other debris forms away from your brain commonly in your heart and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries. This type of blood clot is called an embolus.<br><br><b>SYMPTOMS: </b><br><br>-Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg, especially on one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Similarly, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.<br><br>-Trouble with seeing in one or both eyes. You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.<br><br>-Headache. A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate you're having a stroke.<br><br>-Trouble with walking. You may stumble or experience sudden dizziness, loss of balance or loss of coordination.<br><br>-Trouble with speaking and understanding. You may experience confusion. You may slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech. <br><br><b>Ischemic stroke treatment:</b><br><br>Doctors must quickly restore blood flow to your brain.<br>Emergency treatment with medications.<br>Therapy with clot-busting drugs must start within 3 hours if they are given into the vein and the sooner, the better. <br>Quick treatment not only improves your chances of survival but also may reduce complications. <br><br><b>You may be given:</b><br>-<b>Aspirin</b><br>-Aspirin is an immediate treatment given in the emergency room to reduce the likelihood of having another stroke. Aspirin prevents blood clots from forming.<br><br>-<b>Intravenous injection of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)</b><br>-Some people can benefit from an injection of a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), also called alteplase. An injection of TPA is usually given through a vein in the arm. This potent clot-busting drug needs to be given within 4.5 hours after stroke symptoms begin if it's given in the vein.<br><br>TPA restores blood flow by dissolving the blood clot causing your stroke, and it may help people who have had strokes recover more fully. Your doctor will consider certain risks, such as potential bleeding in the brain, to determine if TPA is appropriate for you.<br><br><b>Emergency procedures: </b><br><br>Doctors sometimes treat ischemic strokes with procedures that must be performed as soon as possible, depending on features of the blood clot:<br><br>-<b>Medications delivered directly to the brain</b><br>-Doctors may insert a long, thin tube (catheter) through an artery in your groin and thread it to your brain to deliver TPA directly into the area where the stroke is occurring. The time window for this treatment is somewhat longer than for intravenous TPA but is still limited.<br><br>-<b>Mechanical clot removal</b><br>-Doctors may use a catheter to maneuver a tiny device into your brain to physically break up or grab and remove the clot.<br><br>However, recent studies suggest that for most people, delivering medication directly to the brain (intra-arterial thrombolysis) or using a device to break up or remove clots (mechanical thrombectomy) may not be beneficial. Researchers are working to determine who might benefit from this procedure.<br><br><b>Other procedures:</b><br><br>To decrease your risk of having another stroke or transient ischemic attack, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open up an artery that's narrowed by fatty deposits (plaques). Doctors sometimes recommend the following procedures to prevent a stroke. Options will vary depending on your situation:<br><br>-<b>Carotid endarterectomy</b><br>-In a carotid endarterectomy, a surgeon removes plaques from arteries that run along each side of your neck to your brain (carotid arteries). In this procedure, your surgeon makes an incision along the front of your neck, opens your carotid artery and removes plaques that block the carotid artery.<br><br>Your surgeon then repairs the artery with stitches or a patch made from a vein or artificial material (graft).<br><br>The procedure may reduce your risk of ischemic stroke. However, a carotid endarterectomy also involves risks, especially for people with heart disease or other medical conditions.<br><br>-<b>Angioplasty and stents</b><br>- In an angioplasty, a surgeon gains access to your carotid arteries most often through an artery in your groin. Here, he or she can gently and safely navigate to the carotid arteries in your neck. A balloon is then used to expand the narrowed artery. Then a stent can be inserted to support the opened artery.</p>

            <h4>Influenza and pneumonia</h4>
               <p><b>Symptoms</b><br>The abrupt onset of a headache<br>Dry cough and chills<br>Rapidly followed by overall achiness and a fever that may run as high as 104°F (40°C). <br><br>As the fever subsides, nasal congestion and a sore throat become noticeable. <br>Flu victims feel extremely tired and weak and may not return to their normal energy levels for several days or even a couple of weeks.<br><br>Influenza complications usually arise from bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.<br><br><b>Signs of a secondary respiratory infection</b> Often appear just as the victim seems to be recovering. <br><b>These signs include</b> <br>High fever<br>Intense Chills<br>Chest Pains associated with breathing <br>And a productive cough with thick yellowish green sputum. <br>If these symptoms appear, medical treatment is necessary. Other secondary infections, such as sinus or ear infections, may also require medical intervention. Heart and lung problems, and other chronic diseases, can be aggravated by influenza, which is aparticular concern with elderly patients.<br>With children and teenagers, it is advisable to be alert for symptoms of Reye's syndrome, a rare, but serious complication.Symptoms of Reye's syndrome are nausea and vomiting, and more seriously, neurological problems such as confusionor delirium. The syndrome has been associated with the use of aspirin to relieve flu symptoms.<br><br><b>Treatments</b><br>-   <b>Acupuncture and acupressure</b><br>-Both are said to stimulate natural resistance, relieve nasal congestion and headaches, fight fever, and calm coughs, depending on the acupuncture and acupressure points used.<br><br>-    <b>Aromatherapy</b><br>-Aromatherapists recommend gargling daily with one drop each of the essential oils of tea tree(Melaleuca spp.) and lemon mixed in a glass of warm water. If already suffering from the flu, two drops of tea tree oil ina hot bath may help ease the symptoms. Essential oils of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) or peppermint (Menthapiperita) added to a steam vaporizer may help clear chest and nasal congestion.<br><br>-    <b>Herbal remedies</b><br>-Herbal remedies can be used stimulate the immune system (echinacea), as antivirals (Hydrastiscanadensis) goldenseal and garlic (Allium sativum), or directed at whatever symptoms arise as a result of the flu. Forexample, an infusion of boneset (Eupatroium perfoliatum) may counteract aches and fever, and yarrow (Achilleamillefolium) or elderflower tinctures may combat chills.<br><br>-  <b>Homeopathy</b><br>-To prevent flu, a homeopathic remedy called Oscillococcinum may be taken at the first sign of flusymptoms and repeated for a day or two. Although oscillococcinum is a popular flu remedy in Europe, however, aresearch study published in 2003 found it to be ineffective. Other homeopathic remedies recommended vary accordingto the specific flu symptoms present. Gelsemium (Gelsemium sempervirens) is recommended to combat weaknessaccompanied by chills, a headache, and nasal congestion. Bryonia (Bryonia alba) may be used to treat muscle aches,headaches, and a dry cough. For restlessness, chills, hoarseness, and achy joints, poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron) isrecommended. Finally, for achiness and a dry cough or chills, Eupatorium perfoliatum is suggested.<br><br>-   <b>Hydrotherapy</b><br>-A bath to induce a fever will speed recovery from the flu by creating an environment in the body wherethe flu virus cannot survive. The patient should take a bath as hot as he/she can tolerate and remain in the bath for 20-30 minutes. While in the bath, the patient drinks a cup of yarrow or elderflower tea to induce sweating. During thebath, a cold cloth is held on the forehead or at the nape of the neck to keep the temperature down in the brain. Thepatient is assisted when getting out of the bath (he/she may feel weak or dizzy) and then gets into bed and covers upwith layers of blankets to induce more sweating.<br><br>-  <b>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)</b> <br>-Practitioners of TCM recommend mixtures of herbs to prevent flu as well as torelieve symptoms once a person has fallen ill. There are several different recipes for these remedies, but most containginger and Japanese honeysuckle in addition to other ingredients.<br><br>- <b>Vitamins</b><br>-For adults, 2-3 grams of vitamin C daily may help prevent the flu. Increasing the dose to 5-7 grams per dayduring the flu can help fight the infection. (The dose should be reduced if diarrhea develops.)<br></p>

            <h4>Hypertension</h4>
               <p><b>High blood pressure</b> is classified as either primary (essential) high blood pressure or secondary high blood pressure. About 90-95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt, excess body weight, smoking, and alcohol. The remaining 5-10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure, defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.<br><br>Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60-90 mmHg diastolic. High blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg for most adults. Different numbers apply to children. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office best blood pressure measurement.<br><br>Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications. Lifestyle changes include weight loss, decreased salt intake, physical exercise, and a healthy diet. If lifestyle changes are not sufficient then blood pressure medications are used. Up to three medications can control blood pressure in 90% of people. The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure (defined as &gt;160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy. The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 140/90 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefit and others finding a lack of evidence for benefit. High blood pressure affects between 16 and 37% of the population globally. In 2010 hypertension was believed to have been a factor in 18% of all deaths (9.4 million globally).<br><br>If your blood pressure is extremely high, there may be certain symptoms to look out for, including:<br><br>-Severe headache<br>-Fatigue or confusion<br>-Vision problems<br>-Chest pain<br>-Difficulty breathing<br>-Irregular heartbeat<br>-Blood in the urine<br>-Pounding in your chest, neck, or ears<br><br><b>Medications to treat high blood pressure</b><br><br>-    <b>Thiazide diuretics</b>. Diuretics, sometimes called water pills, are medications that act on your kidneys to help your body eliminate sodium and water, reducing blood volume.<br><br>Thiazide diuretics are often the first, but not the only, choice in high blood pressure medications. Thiazide diuretics include hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide), chlorthalidone and others.<br><br>If you're not taking a diuretic and your blood pressure remains high, talk to your doctor about adding one or replacing a drug you currently take with a diuretic. Diuretics or calcium channel blockers may work better for black and older people than do angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors alone. A common side effect of diuretics is increased urination.<br><br><br>-    <b>Beta blockers</b>. These medications reduce the workload on your heart and open your blood vessels, causing your heart to beat slower and with less force. Beta blockers include acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin) and others.<br><br>When prescribed alone, beta blockers don't work as well, especially in black and older people, but may be effective when combined with other blood pressure medications.<br><br><br>-    <b>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</b>. These medications such as lisinopril (Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten) and others help relax blood vessels by blocking the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. People with chronic kidney disease may benefit from having an ACE inhibitor as one of their medications.<br><br><br>-    <b>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)</b>. These medications help relax blood vessels by blocking the action, not the formation, of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. ARBs include candesartan (Atacand), losartan (Cozaar) and others. People with chronic kidney disease may benefit from having an ARB as one of their medications.<br><br><br>-    <b>Calcium channel blockers</b>. These medications including amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and others<br>help relax the muscles of your blood vessels. Some slow your heart rate. Calcium channel blockers may work better for black and older people than do ACE inhibitors alone.<br>Grapefruit juice interacts with some calcium channel blockers, increasing blood levels of the medication and putting you at higher risk of side effects. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're concerned about interactions.<br><br><br>-    <b>Renin inhibitors</b>. Aliskiren (Tekturna) slows down the production of renin, an enzyme produced by your kidneys that starts a chain of chemical steps that increases blood pressure.<br>Tekturna works by reducing the ability of renin to begin this process. Due to a risk of serious complications, including stroke, you shouldn't take aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.<br></p>

            <h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
               <p><b>Causes</b><br><br>It's not clear what causes breast cancer.<br><br>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin growing abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. The cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br><br>Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.<br><br>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.<br><br><br><b>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</b><br><br><br>-    A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue<br><br>-    Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast<br><br>-    Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling<br><br>-    A newly inverted nipple<br><br>-    Peeling, scaling or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin<br><br>-    Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange<br><br></p>

            <h4>HIV/AIDS</h4>
               <p>By the end of 2012, 35.3 million people around the world were infected with HIV. Every day, about 5,700 more become infected. Rates vary dramatically by geographical location. HIV is rampant in sub-Saharan Africa, where almost one in 20 adults has it. The region is home to 70 percent of all people who have HIV. Sadly, it's also home to 91 percent of the HIV-positive children in the world. <br><br><b>Symptoms:</b><br>fever<br>chills<br>joint pain<br>muscle aches<br>sore throat<br>sweats (particularly at night)<br>enlarged glands<br>a red rash<br>tiredness<br>weakness<br>unintentional weight loss<br>Asymptomatic HIV<br><br>In many cases, after the initial symptoms disappear, there will not be any further symptoms for many years.<br><br>During this time, the virus carries on developing and damaging the immune system and organs. Without being on medications to stop HIV's replication, this process can take up to 10 years on average. The infected person often experiences no symptoms, feels well, and appears healthy.<br><br><b>Late-stage HIV infection</b><br>If left untreated, HIV weakens the ability to fight infection. The person becomes vulnerable to serious illnesses. This stage of infection is known as AIDS.<br><b>Symptoms of late-stage HIV infection may include:</b><br>blurred vision<br>diarrhea, which is usually persistent or chronic<br>dry cough<br>fever of above 100 °F (37 °C) lasting for weeks<br>night sweats<br>permanent tiredness<br>shortness of breath (dyspnea)<br>swollen glands lasting for weeks<br>unintentional weight loss<br>white spots on the tongue or mouth<br>During late-stage HIV infection, the risk of developing a life-threatening illness is much greater. Life-threatening illnesses may be controlled, avoided,and/or treated with proper medications, often including HIV treatment.<br><br><b>HIV and AIDS myths and facts</b><br>There are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS. The virus<b>CANNOT</b> be transmitted from:<br>shaking hands<br>hugging<br>casual kissing<br>sneezing<br>touching unbroken skin<br>using the same toilet<br>sharing towels<br>sharing cutlery<br>mouth-to-mouth resuscitation<br>or other forms of "casual contact"<br><br><b>How is HIV treated?</b><br>The standard treatment for HIV is a combination of medicines called antiretroviral therapy, or ART. Antiretroviral medicines slow the rate at which the virus multiplies.<br><br><b>Antiretroviral therapy (ART)</b><br>-Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the combination of several antiretroviral medicines used to slow the rate at which HIV makes copies of itself (multiplies) in the body. A combination of three or more antiretroviral medicines is more effective than using just one medicine (monotherapy) to treat HIV.<br><br>The use of three or more antiretroviral medicines-sometimes referred to as an anti-HIV "cocktail"-is currently the standard treatment for HIV infection. So far, this treatment offers the best chance of preventing HIV from multiplying, which allows your immune system to stay healthy. The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to reduce the amount of virus in your body (viral load) to a level that can no longer be detected with current blood tests.<br><br>Antiretroviral medicines that are often used to treat HIV include: <br>Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, also called nucleoside analogs, such as abacavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. These medicines are often combined for best results.<br>Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine.<br>Protease inhibitors (PIs), such as atazanavir, darunavir, and ritonavir.<br>Entry inhibitors, such as enfuvirtide and maraviroc.<br>Integrase inhibitors, such as dolutegravir and raltegravir.<br>Some medicines are available combined together in one pill. This reduces the number of pills to be taken each day. <br>Also, studies have shown that if you are not infected with HIV, taking antiretroviral medicines can protect you against HIV.2, 3 But to keep your risk low, you still need to use safer sex practices.</p>

            <h4>Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
               <p><b>Diabetes</b> is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar.<br><br><b>Hyperglycaemia</b> or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.<br>In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2012 diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and high blood glucose was the cause of another 2.2 million deaths.<br><br><b>Type 1 diabetes(previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset)</b><br>- is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin 3. The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known and it is not preventable with current knowledge.<br><br><b>Type 2 diabetes(formerly called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset)</b><br>-results from the bodys ineffective use of insulin 3. Type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of people with diabetes around the world 3, and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.<br><br><b>Symptoms:</b><br>Include excessive excretion of urine (polyuria) <br>Thirst (polydipsia) <br>Constant Hunger <br>Weight Loss Vision Changes And Fatigue.<br>These symptoms may occur suddenly.<br><br><b>Prevention</b><br>Simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. To help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:<br>-achieve and maintain healthy body weight;<br>-be physically active at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most days. More activity is required for weight control;<br>-eat a healthy diet, avoiding sugar and saturated fats intake; and<br>-avoid tobacco use smoking increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.<br><br><b>Diagnosis and treatment</b><br>Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood sugar.<br>Treatment of diabetes involves diet and physical activity along with lowering blood glucose and the levels of other known risk factors that damage blood vessels.<br>Tobacco use cessation is also important to avoid complications.<br><br>Interventions that are both cost-saving and feasible in developing countries include 8:<br>-blood glucose control, particularly in type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes require insulin, people with type 2 diabetes can be treated with oral medication, but may also require insulin;<br>-blood pressure control; and<br>-foot care.<br><br><b>Other cost saving interventions include:</b><br>-screening and treatment for retinopathy (which causes blindness);<br>-blood lipid control (to regulate cholesterol levels);<br>-screening for early signs of diabetes-related kidney disease and treatment.</p>

            <h4>Preterm Birth Complications</h4>
               <p>According to WHO, in 2012, as many as 1.1 million deaths were due to prematurity and complications due to low birth weight. Three-quarters of these deaths happen within the first week of life. Lack of skilled medical care makes this a huge problem in developing countries. Many newborn deaths could be avoided with good prenatal and postnatal care.<br><br><b>Symptoms OF PREMATURE INFANT</b><br>The infant may have trouble breathing and keeping a constant body temperature.<br><br><b>Treatment FOR PREMATURE INFANT</b><br>-When premature labor develops and cannot be stopped, the health care team will prepare for a high-risk birth. The mother may be moved to a center that is set up to care for premature infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).<br><br>-After birth, the baby is admitted to a high-risk nursery. The infant is placed under a warmer or in a clear, heated box called an incubator, which controls the air temperature. Monitoring machines track the baby's breathing, heart rate, and level of oxygen in the blood.<br><br>-A premature infant's organs are not fully developed. The infant needs special care in a nursery until the organs have developed enough to keep the baby alive without medical support. This may take weeks to months.<br><br>-Infants usually cannot coordinate sucking and swallowing before 34 weeks gestation. A premature baby may have a small, soft feeding tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. In very premature or sick infants, nutrition may be given through a vein until the baby is stable enough to receive all nutrition through the stomach. (See: Neonatal weight gain and nutrition)<br></p>

            <h4>Tuberculosis (TB)</h4>
               <p>TB is a lung condition caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It's an airborne disease that is often successfully treated. Some strains of TB are resistant to conventional treatments. Second-line drugs used to treat these patients are in limited supply. Some strains fail to respond to second-line treatment as well.<br><br>In 2012, about 900,000 people lost their lives to TB, according to WHO estimates. The majority of TB-related deaths happen in poorer countries. It is one of the top causes of death for people who have HIV.<br><br><b>Who is most at risk?</b><br>Tuberculosis mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries.<br>People who are infected with HIV are 20 to 30 times more likely to develop active TB (see TB and HIV section below). The risk of active TB is also greater in persons suffering from other conditions that impair the immune system.<br>One million children (0-14 years of age) fell ill with TB, and 170 000 children (excluding children with HIV) died from the disease in 2015.<br>Tobacco use greatly increases the risk of TB disease and death. More than 20% of TB cases worldwide are attributable to smoking.<br><br><b>Global impact of TB</b><br>TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2015, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in Asia, with 61% of new cases, followed by Africa, with 26% of new cases.<br>In 2015, 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries. Six countries accounted for 60% of the new TB cases: India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa. Global progress depends on advances in TB prevention and care in these countries.<br><br><b>Symptoms and diagnosis</b><br>Common symptoms of active lung TB are cough with sputum and blood at times, chest pains, weakness, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Many countries still rely on a long-used method called sputum smear microscopy to diagnose TB. Trained laboratory technicians look at sputum samples under a microscope to see if TB bacteria are present. Microscopy detects only half the number of TB cases and cannot detect drug-resistance.<br>The use of the rapid test Xpert MTB/RIFÂ® has expanded substantially since 2010, when WHO first recommended its use. The test simultaneously detects TB and resistance to rifampicin, the most important TB medicine. Diagnosis can be made within 2 hours and the test is now recommended by WHO as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB. More than 100 countries are already using the test and 6.2 million cartridges were procured globally in 2015.<br>Diagnosing multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (see Multidrug-resistant TB section below) as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive. In 2016, 4 new diagnostic tests were recommended by WHO - a rapid molecular test to detect TB at peripheral health centres where Xpert MTB/RIF cannot be used, and 3 tests to detect resistance to first- and second-line TB medicines.<br>Tuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children and as yet only the Xpert MTB/RIF assay is generally available to assist with the diagnosis of paediatric TB.<br><br><b>Treatment</b><br>TB is a treatable and curable disease. Active, drug-susceptible TB disease is treated with a standard 6 month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs that are provided with information, supervision and support to the patient by a health worker or trained volunteer. Without such support, treatment adherence can be difficult and the disease can spread. The vast majority of TB cases can be cured when medicines are provided and taken properly.<br>Between 2000 and 2015, an estimated 49 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment.<br><br><b>Multidrug-resistant TB</b><br>Anti-TB medicines have been used for decades and strains that are resistant to 1 or more of the medicines have been documented in every country surveyed. Drug resistance emerges when anti-TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, and patients stopping treatment prematurely.<br>Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most powerful, first-line anti-TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs. However, second-line treatment options are limited and require extensive chemotherapy (up to 2 years of treatment) with medicines that are expensive and toxic.<br>In some cases, more severe drug resistance can develop. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a more serious form of MDR-TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line anti-TB drugs, often leaving patients without any further treatment options.<br>About 480 000 people worldwide developed MDR-TB in 2015. In addition, around 100 000 people developed resistance to rifampicin (the most effective first-line medicine) and needed MDR-TB treatment. The MDR-TB burden largely falls on 3 countries - China, India, and the Russian Federation - which together account for nearly half of the global cases. About 9.5% of MDR-TB cases had XDR-TB in 2015.<br>Worldwide, only 52% of MDR-TB patients and 28% of XDR-TB are currently successfully treated. In 2016, WHO approved the use of a short, standardised regimen for MDR-TB patients who do not have strains that are resistant to second-line TB medicines. This regimen takes 9-12 months and is much less expensive than the conventional treatment for MDR-TB, which can take up to 2 years. Patients with XDR-TB or resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs cannot use this regimen, however, and need to be put on longer MDR-TB regimens to which 1 of the new drugs (bedquiline and delamanid) may be added.<br>WHO also approved in 2016 a rapid diagnostic test to quickly identify these patients. More than 20 countries in Africa and Asia have started using shorter MDR-TB regimens. By the end of 2015, 70 countries had introduced bedaquiline and 39 countries had introduced delamanid, in an effort to improve the effectiveness of MDR-TB treatment regimens.<br></p>

            <h4>Fever</h4>
               <p><b>What are the signs and symptoms of a fever?</b><br>A fever can cause a person to feel very uncomfortable. <br>Signs and symptoms of a fever include the following:<br>- Temperature greater than 100.4 F (38 C) in adults and children<br>- Shivering, shaking, and chills<br>- Aching muscles and joints or other body aches<br>- Headache<br>- Intermittent sweats or excessive sweating<br>- Rapid heart rate and/or palpitations<br>- Skin flushing or hot skin<br>- Feeling faint, dizzy, or lightheaded<br>- Eye pain or sore eyes<br>- Weakness<br>- Loss of appetite<br>- Fussiness (in children and toddlers)<br>- Also important to note in children are symptoms that can accompany an infection, including sore throat, cough, earache, vomiting, and diarrhea<br>- With very high temperatures (&gt;104 F/40 C), convulsions, hallucinations, or confusion is possible. Always seek medical attention for a high fever or if these symptoms occur.<br><br><b>What is the treatment for a fever?</b><br>Generally, if the fever does not cause discomfort, the fever itself need not be treated.<br>It is not necessary to awaken an adult or child to treat a fever unless instructed to do so by a doctor.<br>The following fever-reducing medications may be used at home:<br>-<b> Acetaminophen (Tylenol and others)</b><br>-Can be used to lower a fever. The recommended pediatric dose can be suggested by the child's pediatrician. Adults without liver disease or other health problems can take 1,000 mg (two "extra-strength" tablets) every six hours or as directed by a physician. The makers of Tylenol state the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen per day is 3,000 mg, or six extra-strength tablets per 24 hours, unless directed by a doctor. Regular-strength Tylenol tablets are 325 mg; the recommended dosage for these is two tablets every four to six hours, not to exceed 10 tablets per 24 hours. If your fever is accompanied by vomiting and you are unable to keep oral medications down, ask a pharmacist for acetaminophen suppositories, which are available without a prescription.<br><br>- <b>Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)</b><br>-Can also be used to break a fever in patients over 6 months of age. Discuss the best dose with a doctor. For adults, generally 400 mg to 600 mg (two to three 200 mg tablets) can be used every six hours as fever reducers.<br><br>- <b>Naproxen (Aleve)</b><br>-Is another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can temporarily reduce fever. The adult dose is two tablets every 12 hours.<br></p>

Symptoms differ from person to person and according to the type of seizure.<br>-Focal (partial) seizures<br>-A simple partial seizure doesn't involve loss of -consciousness.<br>Symptoms include:<br>-Alterations to sense of taste, smell, sight, hearing, or touch<br>-Dizziness<br>-Tingling and Twitching of Limbs<br><br><b>Complex partial seizures</b><br>Other symptoms include:<br>- Involve loss of awareness or consciousness. <br>-Staring Blankly<br>-Unresponsiveness<br>-Performing repetitive movements<br>-Generalized seizures<br>-Generalized seizures involve the whole brain.<br><br>Absence seizures <br>-which used to be called â€œpetit mal seizures,â€ cause a blank stare. This type of seizure may also cause repetitive movements like lip smacking or blinking. There's also usually a short loss of awareness.<br><br>Tonic seizures -cause muscle stiffness.<br><br>Atonic seizures<br>-lead to loss of muscle control and can make you fall down suddenly.<br><br><b>What causes epilepsy?</b><br>For 6 out of 10 people with epilepsy, the cause can't be determined. <br>A variety of things can lead to seizures.<br>Possible causes include:<br>-Traumatic Brain Injury<br>-Scarring on the brain after a brain injury (post-traumatic epilepsy) <br>-Serious illness or very high fever<br>-Stroke, which is a leading cause of epilepsy in people over age 35<br>-Other vascular diseases<br>-Lack of oxygen to the brain<br>-Brain tumor or cyst<br>-Dementia or Alzheimer's disease<br>-Maternal drug use, Prenatal Injury, Brain<br>-Malformation, or Lack of Oxygen at birth<br>-Infectious diseases such as AIDS and Meningitis<br>-Genetic or Developmental Disorders or<br>-Neurological Diseases<br><br><b>How is epilepsy treated?</b><br>Most people can manage epilepsy. <br>Your treatment plan will be based on severity of symptoms, your health, and how well you respond to therapy.<br>Some treatment options include:<br><b>Anti-epileptic (anticonvulsant, antiseizure) drugs</b><br>- These medications can reduce the number of seizures you have. In some people, they eliminate seizures. To be effective, the medication must be taken exactly as prescribed.<br><br><b>Vagus nerve stimulator</b><br>-This device is surgically placed under the skin on the chest and electrically stimulates the nerve that runs through your neck. This can help prevent seizures.<br><br><b>Ketogenic diet</b><br>-More than half of people who don't respond to medication benefit from this high fat, low carbohydrate diet.<br><br><b>Brain surgery</b><br>-The area of the brain that causes seizure activity can be removed or altered.<br>- One treatment that may be available in the future is deep brain stimulation- It's a procedure in which electrodes are implanted into your brain. <br>Then a generator is implanted in your chest. The generator sends electrical impulses to the brain to help decrease seizures.</p>

            <h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
               <p><b>Causes</b><br><br>It's not clear what causes breast cancer.<br><br>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin growing abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. The cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br><br>Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.<br><br>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.<br><br><br>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:<br><br><br>- A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue<br><br>- Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast<br><br>- Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling<br><br>- A newly inverted nipple<br><br>- Peeling, scaling or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin<br><br>- Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange<br></p>

                <h4>FIRST AID</h4>
                   <p><b>FIRST AID Steps</b><br>By administering immediate care during an emergency, you can help an ill or injured person before EMS, Emergency Medical Services arrive. And you may be able to help save a life. However, even after training, remembering the right FIRST AID steps – and administering them correctly – can be difficult. In order to help you deliver the right care at the right time, we've created this simple step-by-step guide that you can print up and place on your refrigerator, in your car, in your bag or at your desk.<br><br>1.Before administering care to an ill or injured person, check the scene and the person. Size up the scene and form an initial impression.<br>Pause and looks at the scene and the person before responding. Answer the following questions:<br>- Is the scene safe to enter?<br>- What happened?<br>- How many people are involved?<br>- What is my initial impression about the nature of the person’s illness or injury? Does the person have any life-threatening conditions, such as severe, life-threatening bleeding?<br>- Is anyone else available to help?<br><br>2.If the Person is awake and Responsive and there is no severe life-threatening bleeding:<br>- Obtain consent: Tell the person your name, describes type and level of training, states what you thinks is wrong and what you plans to do, and asks permission to provide care.<br>- Tell a bystander to get the AED( Automated External Defibrillator) and FIRST AID kit: Point to a bystander and speak out loud.<br>- Use appropriate PPE(Personal Protective Equipment): Put on gloves, if available.<br>- Interview the person: Uses SAMPLE questions to gather more information about signs and symptoms, allergies, medications, pertinent medical history, last food or drink and events leading up to the incident.<br>- Conduct a head-to-toe check: Check head and neck, shoulders, chest and abdomen, hips, legs and feet, arms and hands for signs of injury.<br>- Provide care consistent with knowledge and training according to the conditions you find.<br><br>3.If the Person Appears Unresponsive:<br>Shout to get the person’s attention, using the person’s name if it is known. If there is no response, tap the person’s shoulder (if the person is an adult or child) or the bottom of the person’s foot (if the person is an infant) and shout again, while checking for normal breathing. Check for Responsiveness and breathing for no more than 5-10 seconds.<br><br>4.If the person is breathing:<br>- Send someone to call 911 or the designated emergency number and obtain an AED(Automated External Defibrillator) and FIRST AID kit.<br>- Proceed with gathering information from bystanders using the SAMPLE questions ?<br>- Conduct a head-to-toe check.<br>- Roll the person onto his or her side into a recovery position if there are no obvious signs of injury.<br><br>5.If the person is NOT breathing:<br>- Send someone to call 911 or the designated emergency number and obtain an AED(Automated External Defibrillator) and FIRST AID kit.<br>- Ensure that the person is face-up on a firm, flat surface such as the floor or ground.<br>- Begin CPR (starting with compressions) or use an AED(Automated External Defibrillator) if one is immediately available, if you are trained in giving CPR and using an AED.<br>- Continue administering CPR until the person exhibits signs of life, such as breathing, an AED becomes available, or EMS or trained medical responders arrive on scene.<br>Note: End CPR if the scene becomes unsafe or you cannot continue due to exhaustion.<br>Additional Information<br>To see the steps to perform FIRST AID and learn how to administer care properly, watch our videos:<br>•  Giving CPR (Adult)<br>• Giving CPR (Adult/Child)<br>• Giving CPR (Infant)<br></p>

            <h4>Coronary Artery Disease (IHD)</h4>
            <p>Ischemic Heart Disease(IHD)
                <br>Among the risk factors are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Regular exercise, good nutrition, and weight control can help lower your risk of developing CAD.
                <br>
                <br>Where you live matters. Although its still the leading cause of death, mortality rates have declined in many European countries and in the United States. This may be due to better prevention and access to quality healthcare. However, in many developing nations, mortality rates due to CAD are on the rise.
                <br>
                <br><b>Symptoms</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>If your coronary arteries narrow, they can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially when it's beating hard, such as during exercise. At first, the decreased blood flow may not cause any coronary artery disease symptoms. As plaque continues to build up in your coronary arteries, however, you may develop coronary artery disease signs and symptoms, including:
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br><b>Chest pain (angina)</b>: You may feel pressure or tightness in your chest, as if someone were standing on your chest. This pain, referred to as angina, usually occurs on the middle or left side of the chest. Angina is generally triggered by physical or emotional stress.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>The pain usually goes away within minutes after stopping the stressful activity. In some people, especially women, this pain may be fleeting or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br><b>Shortness of breath</b>: If your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue with exertion.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br><b>Heart attack</b>: A completely blocked coronary artery may cause a heart attack. The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing pressure in your chest and pain in your shoulder or arm, sometimes with shortness of breath and sweating.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Women are somewhat more likely than men are to experience less typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as neck or jaw pain. Sometimes a heart attack occurs without any apparent signs or symptoms.
                <br>
                <br>Treatments for Coronary Artery Disease usually involves lifestyle changes and, if necessary, drugs and certain medical procedures.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Lifestyle changes
                <br>
                <br>Making a commitment to the following healthy lifestyle changes can go a long way toward promoting healthier arteries:

            <h4>Stroke</h4>
            <p>A stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is interrupted or reduced. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die.
                <br>
                <br> A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke).
                <br>
                <br><b>Ischemic strokes</b> occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia).
                <br> The most common ischemic strokes include:
                <br>
                <br>

            <h4>Influenza and pneumonia</h4>
            <p>In 2012, the University of Philippines College of Medicine reported that pneumonia was the leading cause of death among children aged one to four years old.
                <br>
                <br>Around Two million children die every year because of this serious lung disease, which can lead to fatal complications.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Despite the intensive campaign of the government to prevent deaths due to pneumonia, it still is the third leading cause of death in the Philippines at 9.95%.
                <br>
                <br><b>Treatment</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>There is no cure for <b>COPD</b>. But there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>If you smoke, now is the time to quit. This is the best way to slow lung damage.
                <br>
                <br>Medicines used to treat COPD include:
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Inhalers (bronchodilators) COPD</b>-- quick-relief drugs to help open the airways
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Inhaled COPD</b> -- control drugs or oral steroids to reduce lung inflammation
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Anti-inflammatory drugs</b>- to reduce swelling in the airways
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Certain long-term antibiotics</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>In severe cases or during flare-ups, you may need to receive:
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Steroids by mouth or through a vein (intravenously)<br><br>-    Bronchodilators through a nebulizer<br><br>-    Oxygen therapy<br><br>-    Assistance from a machine to help breathing by using a mask, BiPAP, or through the use of an endotracheal tube</b>
                <br>
                <br>Your health care provider may prescribe antibiotics during symptom flare-ups, because an infection can make COPD worse.
                <br>
                <br>You may need oxygen therapy at home if you have a low level of oxygen in your blood.
                <br>
                <br><b>Pulmonary rehabilitation</b> does not cure COPD. But it can teach you to breathe in a different way so you can stay active and feel better.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Approximately one to four days after infection with the influenza virus, the victim is hit with an array of symptoms. "Hit" is an appropriate term, because symptoms are sudden, harsh, and unmistakable.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br><b>Typical influenza symptoms include</b>
                <br><b>The Abrupt onset of a headache<br> Dry Cough, and Chills<br> Rapidly followed by overall Itchiness and a fever that may run as high as 104°F (40°C).<br><br></b>
                <br>As the fever subsides, nasal congestion and a sore throat become noticeable.
                <br>Flu victims feel extremely tired and weak and may not return to their normal energy levels for several days or even a couple of weeks.
                <br>Influenza complications usually arise from bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br><b>Signs of a secondary respiratory infection often appear just as the victim seems to be recovering.<br></b>

            <h4>Hypertension</h4>
            <p><b>High blood pressure</b> is classified as either primary (essential) high blood pressure or secondary high blood pressure. About 90-95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt, excess body weight, smoking, and alcohol. The remaining 5-10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure, defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.
                <br>
                <br>Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60-90 mmHg diastolic. High blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg for most adults. Different numbers apply to children. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office best blood pressure measurement.
                <br>
                <br>Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications. Lifestyle changes include weight loss, decreased salt intake, physical exercise, and a healthy diet. If lifestyle changes are not sufficient then blood pressure medications are used. Up to three medications can control blood pressure in 90% of people. The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure (defined as &gt;160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy. The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 140/90 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefit and others finding a lack of evidence for benefit. High blood pressure affects between 16 and 37% of the population globally. In 2010 hypertension was believed to have been a factor in 18% of all deaths (9.4 million globally).
                <br>
                <br>If your blood pressure is extremely high, there may be certain symptoms to look out for, including:
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Severe headache<br><br>-    Fatigue or confusion<br><br>-    Vision problems<br><br>-    Chest pain<br><br>-    Difficulty breathing<br><br>-    Irregular heartbeat<br><br>-    Blood in the urine<br><br>-    Pounding in your chest, neck, or ears</b>
                <br>
                <br><b>Medications to treat high blood pressure</b>
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Thiazide diuretics</b>. Diuretics, sometimes called water pills, are medications that act on your kidneys to help your body eliminate sodium and water, reducing blood volume.
                <br>Thiazide diuretics are often the first, but not the only, choice in high blood pressure medications. Thiazide diuretics include hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide), chlorthalidone and others.
                <br>If you're not taking a diuretic and your blood pressure remains high, talk to your doctor about adding one or replacing a drug you currently take with a diuretic. Diuretics or calcium channel blockers may work better for black and older people than do angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors alone. A common side effect of diuretics is increased urination.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Beta blockers</b>. These medications reduce the workload on your heart and open your blood vessels, causing your heart to beat slower and with less force. Beta blockers include acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin) and others.
                <br>
                <br>When prescribed alone, beta blockers don't work as well, especially in black and older people, but may be effective when combined with other blood pressure medications.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</b>. These medications Ã¢â‚¬â€ such as lisinopril (Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten) and others Ã¢â‚¬â€ help relax blood vessels by blocking the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. People with chronic kidney disease may benefit from having an ACE inhibitor as one of their medications.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)</b>. These medications help relax blood vessels by blocking the action, not the formation, of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. ARBs include candesartan (Atacand), losartan (Cozaar) and others. People with chronic kidney disease may benefit from having an ARB as one of their medications.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Calcium channel blockers</b>. These medications Ã¢â‚¬â€ including amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and others Ã¢â‚¬â€ help relax the muscles of your blood vessels. Some slow your heart rate. Calcium channel blockers may work better for black and older people than do ACE inhibitors alone.
                <br>Grapefruit juice interacts with some calcium channel blockers, increasing blood levels of the medication and putting you at higher risk of side effects. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're concerned about interactions.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>- <b>Renin inhibitors</b>. Aliskiren (Tekturna) slows down the production of renin, an enzyme produced by your kidneys that starts a chain of chemical steps that increases blood pressure.
                <br>Tekturna works by reducing the ability of renin to begin this process. Due to a risk of serious complications, including stroke, you shouldn't take aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

            <h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
            <p><b>Causes</b>
                <br>
                <br>It's not clear what causes breast cancer.
                <br>
                <br>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin growing abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. The cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.
                <br>
                <br>Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.
                <br>
                <br>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br><b>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>- A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue
                <br>
                <br>- Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
                <br>
                <br>- Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
                <br>
                <br>- A newly inverted nipple
                <br>
                <br>- Peeling, scaling or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin
                <br>
                <br>- Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange

            <h4>HIV/AIDS</h4>
            <p>By the end of 2012, 35.3 million people around the world were infected with HIV. Every day, about 5,700 more become infected. Rates vary dramatically by geographical location. HIV is rampant in sub-Saharan Africa, where almost one in 20 adults has it. The region is home to 70 percent of all people who have HIV. Sadly, its also home to 91 percent of the HIV-positive children in the world.
                <b>The symptoms of early HIV infection may include:</b>
                <br>
                <b>fever<br>
         chills<br>
         joint pain<br>
         muscle aches<br>
         sore throat<br>
         sweats (particularly at night)<br>
         enlarged glands<br>
         a red rash<br>
         tiredness<br>
         weakness<br>
         unintentional weight loss<br>
         Asymptomatic HIV<br>
         </b>
                <br>In many cases, after the initial symptoms disappear, there will not be any further symptoms for many years.
                <br> During this time, the virus carries on developing and damaging the immune system and organs. Without being on medications to stop HIV's replication, this process can take up to 10 years on average. The infected person often experiences no symptoms, feels well, and appears healthy.
                <br>
                <b>Late-stage HIV infection</b>
                <br>If left untreated, HIV weakens the ability to fight infection. The person becomes vulnerable to serious illnesses. This stage of infection is known as AIDS.
                <br>
                <b>Symptoms of late-stage HIV infection may include:</b>
                <b>blurred vision<br>
         diarrhea, which is usually persistent or chronic<br>
         dry cough<br>
         fever of above 100 °F (37 °C) lasting for weeks<br>
         night sweats<br>
         permanent tiredness<br>
         shortness of breath (dyspnea)<br>
         swollen glands lasting for weeks<br>
         unintentional weight loss<br>
         white spots on the tongue or mouth<br>
         During late-stage HIV infection, the risk of developing a life-threatening illness is much greater. Life-threatening illnesses may be controlled, avoided,and/or treated with proper medications, often including HIV treatment.<br>
         </b>
                <br>
                <b>HIV and AIDS myths and facts</b>
                <br> There are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS. The virus <b>CANNOT be transmitted from:</b>
                <br>
                <b>
         shaking hands<br>
         hugging<br>
         casual kissing<br>
         sneezing<br>
         touching unbroken skin<br>
         using the same toilet<br>
         sharing towels<br>
         sharing cutlery<br>
         mouth-to-mouth resuscitation<br>
         or other forms of "casual contact"<br>
         </b>
                <b>How is HIV treated?<br></b> The standard treatment for HIV is a combination of medicines called <b>antiretroviral therapy, or ART</b>. <b>Antiretroviral</b> medicines slow the rate at which the virus multiplies.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Antiretroviral therapy (ART)</b>
                <br>
                <b>Antiretroviral therapy (ART)</b> is the combination of several antiretroviral medicines used to slow the rate at which HIV makes copies of itself (multiplies) in the body. A combination of three or more antiretroviral medicines is more effective than using just one medicine (monotherapy) to treat HIV.
                <br>
                <br> The use of three or more antiretroviral medicines-sometimes referred to as an anti-HIV "cocktail"-is currently the standard treatment for HIV infection. So far, this treatment offers the best chance of preventing HIV from multiplying, which allows your immune system to stay healthy. The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to reduce the amount of virus in your body (viral load) to a level that can no longer be detected with current blood tests.
                <br>
                <b>Antiretroviral medicines that are often used to treat HIV include:</b>
                <br>
                <b>Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, also called nucleoside analogs, such as abacavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. These medicines are often combined for best results.<br>
         Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine.<br>
         Protease inhibitors (PIs), such as atazanavir, darunavir, and ritonavir.<br>
         Entry inhibitors, such as enfuvirtide and maraviroc.<br>
         Integrase inhibitors, such as dolutegravir and raltegravir.<br>
         Some medicines are available combined together in one pill. This reduces the number of pills to be taken each day.
         </b>
                <br> Also, studies have shown that if you are not infected with HIV, taking antiretroviral medicines can protect you against HIV.2, 3 But to keep your risk low, you still need to use safer sex practices.

            <h4>Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
            <p><b>Diabetes</b> is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar.<b>Hyperglycaemia</b> or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.
                <br> In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2012 diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and high blood glucose was the cause of another 2.2 million deaths.
                <b>Type 1 diabetes</b>
                <br>
                <b>Type 1 diabetes</b>(previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin 3. The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known and it is not preventable with current knowledge. Symptoms may be similar to those of Type 1 diabetes, but are often less marked.
                <br> As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, once complications have already arisen.
                <br> Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in children.
                <b>Symptoms</b>:
                <br>
                <b>Include excessive excretion of urine (polyuria)

         <br>Weight Loss Vision Changes And Fatigue.<br>These symptoms may occur suddenly.</b>
                <b>Type 2 diabetes</b>
                <b>Type 2 diabetes</b>: (formerly called <b>non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset</b>) results from the bodys ineffective use of insulin 3. Type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of people with diabetes around the world 3, and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.

            <h4>Fever</h4>
            <p>What are the signs and symptoms of a fever?
                <br>A fever can cause a person to feel very uncomfortable.
                <br>Signs and symptoms of a fever include the following:
                <br>- Temperature greater than 100.4 F (38 C) in adults and children
                <br>- Shivering, shaking, and chills
                <br>- Aching muscles and joints or other body aches
                <br>- Headache
                <br>- Intermittent sweats or excessive sweating
                <br>- Rapid heart rate and/or palpitations
                <br>- Skin flushing or hot skin
                <br>- Feeling faint, dizzy, or lightheaded
                <br>- Eye pain or sore eyes
                <br>- Weakness
                <br>- Loss of appetite
                <br>- Fussiness (in children and toddlers)
                <br>- Also important to note in children are symptoms that can accompany an infection, including sore throat, cough, earache, vomiting, and diarrhea
                <br>- With very high temperatures (&gt;104 F/40 C), convulsions, hallucinations, or confusion is possible. Always seek medical attention for a high fever or if these symptoms occur.
                <br>
                <br>What is the treatment for a fever?
                <br>Generally, if the fever does not cause discomfort, the fever itself need not be treated.
                <br>It is not necessary to awaken an adult or child to treat a fever unless instructed to do so by a doctor.
                <br>The following fever-reducing medications may be used at home:
                <br>- Acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) can be used to lower a fever. The recommended pediatric dose can be suggested by the child's pediatrician. Adults without liver disease or other health problems can take 1,000 mg (two "extra-strength" tablets) every six hours or as directed by a physician. The makers of Tylenol state the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen per day is 3,000 mg, or six extra-strength tablets per 24 hours, unless directed by a doctor. Regular-strength Tylenol tablets are 325 mg; the recommended dosage for these is two tablets every four to six hours, not to exceed 10 tablets per 24 hours. If your fever is accompanied by vomiting and you are unable to keep oral medications down, ask a pharmacist for acetaminophen suppositories, which are available without a prescription.
                <br>
                <br>- Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) can also be used to break a fever in patients over 6 months of age. Discuss the best dose with a doctor. For adults, generally 400 mg to 600 mg (two to three 200 mg tablets) can be used every six hours as fever reducers.
                <br>
                <br>- Naproxen (Aleve) is another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can temporarily reduce fever. The adult dose is two tablets every 12 hours.

            <h4>Ringworm</h4>
            <p>What are the Symptoms of Ringworm?
                <br>Ringwormlooks like a small patch on the skin, which has an inflamed red ring. It spreads towards outwards and enlarges.
                <br>The area inside the ring is grey and patchy.
                <br>The patch gradually grows into a large ring day by day, and hence it is called ringworm.
                <br>There are chances that several times, several patches would occur anywhere in the skin, especially in the case where you get infection by handling an infected animal.
                <br>The rashes might get slightly irritating, and it is very itchy and inflamed sometimes. It depends on which type of fungus has infected your skin, and hence which kind of rash your skin has gotten.
                <br>It is possible that sometimes the fungal skin infection looks like other skin problems namely Psoriasis.
                <br>How To Get The Ringworm Treatment?
                <br>There is a simple and effective way of treating ringworm:
                <br>-The antifungal cream for ringworm, which are also known as ringworm creams.
                <br>The most popular treatment options include the ringworm medicine like ringworm cream and ointments and are available in the market as well as on the web, which are easily gettable.
                <br>For example:

            <h4>Dengue</h4>
            <p><b>Transmission</b>
                <br>Aedes aegypti, the transmitter of the disease, is a day-biting mosquito which lays eggs in clear and stagnant water found in flower vases, cans, rain barrels, old rubber tires, etc. The adult mosquitoes rest in dark places of the house.
                <br><b>Signs and Symptoms</b>
                <br>Sudden onset of high fever which may last 2 to 7 days.
                <br>Joint and muscle pain and pain behind the eyes.
                <br>Weakness
                <br>Skin rashes - maculopapular rash or red tiny spots on the skin called petechiae
                <br>Nosebleeding when fever starts to subside
                <br>Abdominal pain
                <br>Vomiting of coffee-colored matter
                <br>Dark-colored stools
                <br><b>Prevention and Control</b>
                <br>Cover water drums and water pails at all times to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.
                <br>Replace water in flower vases once a week.
                <br>Clean all water containers once a week. Scrub the sides well to remove eggs of mosquitoes sticking to the sides.
                <br>Clean gutters of leaves and debris so that rain water will not collect as breeding places of mosquitoes.
                <br>Old tires used as roof support should be punctured or cut to avoid accumulation of water.
                <br>Collect and dispose all unusable tin cans, jars, bottles and other items that can collect and hold water.
